# PasswordService

**Distributed Systems Project**
```
Overview
The purpose of this project is to gain practical experience in interprocess communication
protocols used in modern distributed systems. You’ll build a distributed user account
management system in two parts. Each part of the project will involve developing a
service which will be able to connect to other services via APIs. Each service will be
submitted separately. The two interconnected services you’ll develop are as follows:

• Part 1: gRPC Password service
• Part 2: RESTful User Account Service
```
**Run the Jar file**
```
run java -jar PasswordService.jar
```

**PasswordServer**
```
Once the .jar file is ran, it should be listening on port 2104
